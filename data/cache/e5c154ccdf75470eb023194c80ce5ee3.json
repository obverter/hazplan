The following is quoted from her letter: As per your procedure the student was recrystallizing silver nitrate (20 g) from high purity (quartz-distilled, deionized) water (~100 mL) by the dropwise addition of high purity ethanol (~1 mL total). After collection of a first crop of crystals (~7 g), the student, follow- ing normal crystallization procedures, produced a second crop of crystals by concentration of the mother liquor by heating on a steam bath, then dropwise addition of another ~1 mL of ethanol. A contact explosion occurred during collection of the second crop when the student agitated the slurry on a sintered glass frit with a spatula. This explosion was quite violent, shattering the glassware involved and sending large chunks of glass as far as fifteen feet away. Very fortunately, the student was not cut by any of the glass shards; however, the potential for major personal injury was present. We were unaware of this danger, but explosions from silver nitrate and ethanol were known to occur and the haz- ards have been documented [Tully, J, P. News Ed. Chem, Soc.) 1941, 19, 250; Chem.

Example: An explosion will occur if dimethylbenzylcarbinol is added to 90% hydrogen peroxide then acidified with concentrated sulfuric acid. Mixtures of ethyl alcohol with concentrated hydrogen peroxide form powerful explosives. Mixtures of hydrogen peroxide and 1-phenyl-2-methyl propyl alcohol tend to explode if acidified with 70% sulfuric acid, [Chem. Eng. News 45(43):73(1967); J, Org. Chem. 28:1893(1963)]. Alkyl hypochlorites are violently explosive. They are readily obtained by reacting hypochlorous acid and alcohols either in aqueous solution or mixed aqueous-carbon tetrachloride solutions. Chlorine plus alcohols would similarly yield alkyl hypochlorites. They decompose in the cold and explode on exposure to sunlight or heat. Tertiary hypochlorites are less unstable than secondary or primary hypochlorites, [NFPA 491 M, 1991]. Base-catalysed reactions of isocyanates with alcohols should be carried out in inert solvents.

Similarities of episodes in Canada have caused the investigation of beer constituents. Reports indicate that all surviving patients drank a brand of beer containing approximately 10 times more cobalt-sulfate than any other beer. The chemical had been added to Canadian beer to improve the stability of foam. Data indicated that the syndrome appeared a month after the addition of cobalt-sulfate to beer and no new cases developed 1 month after the procedure was discontinued. A similar relationship between cobalt addition and the syndrome was noted in Belgium. The absorption of cobalt is extremely variable. It is diminished after a meal, it varies with pH of stomach and upper duodenum, it varies with quantity and type of dietary protein, and is increased if iron deficiency exists. The type of biological activity of cobalt is dependent on concentration of the metal. Cobalt has been found to diminish the contractility of isolated guinea-pig papillary muscle and has a deleterious effect on myocardial function in guinea-pigs and rabbits. A common finding in the cases is that of pericardial effusion, a feature not reported in association with other types of alcoholic cardiomyopathy.
