Approximately 380,000 L of the hydrochloric solution spilled on the ground and flowed towards a nearby river before remedial actions were undertaken. A vapor cloud occurred above the spill and dissipated within 300 m of the spill site. Firefighters initially used water to wash the acid out of the spill area. This spill action was halted to reduce the amount of acid reaching the river. Response crews arrived at the spill site, wearing protective clothing and filter masks. Fourteen truckloads of oyster shells were applied onto the spill area. The shells served a dual purpose; Temporary containment of the acid by building dams with the shells and neutralization. The neutralized residue was then raked and shoveled into containers for disposal. The remaining hydrochloric acid in the leaking tank was transferred to another tank. The acid, that reached the river, killed more than 20 fish and a few blue crabs. Water samples revealed no abnormal environmental effects since the river had been highly polluted for quite some time. Several response personnel developed facial rashes two or three days after the incident. This may have resulted when the winds suddenly shifted direction and increased the exposure of acid fumes to their faces.", "Markup": [{"Start": 50, "Length": 17, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydrochloric%20acid", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-313"}, {"Start": 485, "Length": 5, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-962"}, {"Start": 985, "Length": 17, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydrochloric%20acid", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-313"}, {"Start": 1137, "Length": 5, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Water", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-962"}]}]}}, {"ReferenceNumber": 50, "Description": "PEER REVIEWED", "Reference": ["New York State Department of Health, Hydrochloric Acid Spills in New York State - Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) 1992-1997; Available from, as of July 9, 2007: https://www.health.state.ny.us/environmental/chemicals/hsees/hcl.htm"], "Value": {"StringWithMarkup": [{"String": "Between 1992 and 1997, the New York State Department of Health for the Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) project has recorded information on 129 actual or threatened hydrochloric acid releases in New York State. The quantities of hydrochloric acid released ranged in volume from 1 to 5,000 gallons, and in weight from 1 to 6,000 pounds. Twenty-five (19%) events involved injuries to 144 persons. In these events, 144 individuals were injured, three of whom died. The three fatalities resulted from trauma following a collision between two trucks, one of them transporting pool chemicals. Although the deaths were not from exposure to hydrochloric acid, they are included in the database because the employees were killed during an accidental chemical release from the collision. Thirty events (23%) led to evacuations totaling more than 4,690 persons. The evacuation numbers are estimated minimums because, in some events, the number of persons evacuated or duration of the evacuation order was unavailable, even when the evacuation was ordered by an official. Fifty-six percent of the releases required a HazMat response (72/129).  .... The total of locations (100) exceeds the number of events (94) because six events are described by two locations, for example, piping and storage above ground. Thirty-eight fixed facility events (40%) occurred in piping which included leaky valves within pipes. Problems during piping, storage above ground, and material handling accounted for about two thirds (68%) of the fixed facility events. Fifty-two percent (75/144) of the injured persons were employees of the companies where the release occurred. Injured employees included both persons working at the location of the event and personnel employed nearby and injured during the release. Thirty-five percent of the injured persons (51/144) were members of the general public, four percent of the injured persons (6/144) were responders (emergency medical personnel, firefighters, police, etc.), and eight percent (12/144) were unknown. A few people (11%) were treated at the scene, but the majority of injured persons (80%) were transported to the hospital, treated and released.  The 144 injured persons sustained 216 injuries. The injury total exceeds the number of injured persons because some people sustained more than one injury, for example, respiratory irritation and chemical burns. Thirteen persons sustained three injuries each, the maximum reported. The most prevalent injury, respiratory irritation, was reported by 105 of the injured persons (73%). ...The following are examples of releases that are included in the data:  1. During the delivery of 4,900 gallons of hydrochloric acid to a tank in a chemical plant, the tank ruptured. The tank rupture caused a nearby pipe to break and released a second chemical, sodium hypochlorite. Forty-three persons were treated at nearby hospitals and a two block area was evacuated for four hours. 2. During trash collection, a sanitation worker unknowingly picked up a one gallon container of acid and later crushed it in the hopper. While the acid was fuming, the truck pulled into the Department of Public Works garage. Two sanitation employees working in the garage were injured and required treatment at the hospital for respiratory irritation. 3. A school custodian was absent and called the substitute custodian to direct him to refill the chlorine container used for swimming pool treatment. The substitute custodian mistakenly added sodium hypochlorite to a drum of hydrochloric acid. The off-gassing forced the evacuation of fourteen hundred persons for the rest of the day. Fourteen persons were injured, all suffering from respiratory irritation and some with other injuries. 4. An employee of a restaurant mixed hydrochloric acid and household bleach to clean the floors. Nineteen persons (employees and patrons) were evacuated. Seven persons were transported to area hospitals where five were treated and released, and two were admitted. The other twelve were treated on the scene by Emergency Medical Services.", "Markup": [{"Start": 191, "Length": 17, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydrochloric%20acid", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-313"}, {"Start": 255, "Length": 17, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydrochloric%20acid", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-313"}, {"Start": 659, "Length": 17, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydrochloric%20acid", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-313"}, {"Start": 2701, "Length": 17, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydrochloric%20acid", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-313"}, {"Start": 2848, "Length": 19, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sodium%20hypochlorite", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-23665760"}, {"Start": 3422, "Length": 8, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Chlorine", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "Element-Chlorine"}, {"Start": 3517, "Length": 19, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sodium%20hypochlorite", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-23665760"}, {"Start": 3550, "Length": 17, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydrochloric%20acid", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-313"}, {"Start": 3800, "Length": 17, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydrochloric%20acid", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-313"}]}]}}]}, {"TOCHeading": "Special Reports", "Description": "Special reports on the safety and hazard of this chemical.
