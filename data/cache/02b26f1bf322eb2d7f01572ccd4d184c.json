Exposure to this colorless gas (liquid, if compressed or in aqueous solution) may occur from its use as a fertilizer, chemical intermediate, alkalizer, metal treating/extraction agent, and common household cleaner. Ammonia is hazardous by all routes (ie, dermal, ingestion, inhalation), with the liquid capable of burning the skin, causing permanent eye damage, or corroding the digestive tract upon contact; and the gas capable of causing severe eye damage, pulmonary edema, and even death from spasm, inflammation, and edema of the larynx. OSHA has established an ammonia Permissible Exposure Level (PEL) of 50 ppm as an 8-hr time-weighted average (TWA). The ACGIH recommends an 8-hr TLV-TWA of 25 ppm. Ammonia levels should be controlled through process enclosure and the use of local exhaust and dilution ventilation, as necessary. While its offensive odor may serve as a warning, to assure against ammonia exposure, workers should wear chemical protective clothing composed of butyl rubber, natural rubber, neoprene, nitrile rubber, or polyvinyl chloride (not Viton), gloves, face protection, and, in emergency situations, a self-contained breathing apparatus. Facilities for quick-drenching the body, as well as eye-wash fountains, should be immediately at hand for the worker. Clothing that becomes wet with liquid ammonia should be placed in closed containers until it can be discarded. While this substance does not burn or ignite readily (autoignition temp: 1204 \u00b0F), containers of ammonia may explode in the heat of a fire. For small fires involving ammonia, extinguish with dry chemical or CO2, and for large fires, use water spray, fog, or foam, taking care to prevent fire control or dilution water from causing pollution. More hazardous than its fire potential is ammonia's reactivity with halogens, interhalogens, and oxidizers. These reactions may be violent and/or may form explosive products. Ammonia should be stored in a cool, well-ventilated location, away from sources of ignition, and separate from other chemicals, particularly oxidizing gases (chlorine, bromine, and iodine) and acids. Aqueous ammonia is commonly containerized in steel drums. Anhydrous ammonia is stored and shipped (prohibited in passenger planes) in pressurized containers, fitted with pressure-relief safety devices, and bearing the label, \"Nonflammable Compressed Gas\". For small spills of ammonia, isolate 80 feet in all directions from the spill, ventilate the area, and allow vapor or gas to disperse. For large spills, evacuate the area for 160 feet in all directions, and dike to contain the spill for later recovery or disposal and to prevent runoff from causing pollution.

ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.)

Maintenance workers replaced the rupture disk on that day; however, the closed isolation valve was not reopened. On the morning of June 11, an operator closed a block valve isolating the ammonia pressure control valve from the heat exchanger. The operator then connected a steam line to the process line to clean the piping. The steam flowed through the heat exchanger tubes, heated the liquid ammonia in the exchanger shell, and increased the pressure in the shell. The closed isolation and block valves prevented the increasing ammonia pressure from safely venting through either the ammonia pressure control valve or the rupture disk and relief valve. The pressure in the heat exchanger shell continued climbing until it violently ruptured at about 7:30 a.m. The catastrophic rupture threw debris that struck and killed a Goodyear employee walking through the area. The rupture also released ammonia, exposing five nearby workers to the chemical. One additional worker was injured while exiting the area. Immediately after the rupture and resulting ammonia release, Goodyear evacuated the plant. Medical responders transported the six injured workers. The employee tracking system failed to properly account for all workers and as a result, Goodyear management believed all workers had safely evacuated the affected area. Management declared the incident over the morning of June 11, although debris blocked access to the area immediately surrounding the heat exchanger. Plant responders managed the cleanup while other areas of the facility resumed operations.", "Markup": [{"Start": 97, "Length": 7, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-222"}, {"Start": 419, "Length": 7, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-222"}, {"Start": 626, "Length": 7, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-222"}, {"Start": 762, "Length": 7, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-222"}, {"Start": 818, "Length": 7, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-222"}, {"Start": 1127, "Length": 7, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-222"}, {"Start": 1284, "Length": 7, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ammonia", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-222"}]}]}}, {"ReferenceNumber": 60, "Description": "PEER REVIEWED", "Reference": ["U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board; Safety Bulletin: Dangers of Purging Gas Piping into Buildings p. 3-4 (September 2009).

The hydraulic shock was enabled during the restart of the plant's ammonia refrigeration system following a 7-hour power outage. In addition to the catastrophic failure of roof-mounted piping, the pressure developed by the hydraulic shock event also caused an evaporator coil inside the facility to rupture. The ammonia cloud released from the roofmounted pipe and traveled 0.25 miles across the river adjacent to the plant. Downwind of the ammonia release were crew members on the ships docked at Millard and over 800 contractors working outdoors at a clean-up site for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. One Millard employee sustained injuries after briefly losing consciousness from ammonia inhalation. Nine ship crew members and 143 of the offsite contractors downwind reported exposure. Of the exposed victims, 32 required hospitalization, and 4 were placed in intensive care. ... Approximately 15 minutes after being notified of the release, the Millard Plant Manager called 9-1-1, triggering a response from the Mobile Fire Department (MFD), which arrived on scene 16 minutes later with hazardous materials technicians to assess and mitigate the release. The Theodore Volunteer Fire Department also responded on the south side of the canal. The MFD called the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency and advised shelter-in-place for the surrounding community and the U.S. Coast Guard halted water traffic on the industrial canal. Shortly after the release occurred, contract employees working at the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) vessel and boom decontamination site,7 approximately 0.25 miles south of Millard, became engulfed in the ammonia cloud and immediately started experiencing symptoms of ammonia exposure. The workers were advised to go to their personal cars and evacuate the facility.

The men were badly burned when their protective clothing ignited in the ensuing fire, and one died within 36 hr. ... Several days prior to the accident, employees noted a smell of ammonia and located a leak in the refrigeration system. Steps were taken to isolate the system and repair a leaky valve at the evaporator unit. As they were working, ammonia continued to accumulate in the room. The crew tried to absorb the gas using a 50 lb cylinder of carbon dioxide. This has been effective for small amounts of ammonia but was not recommended for large leaks. The carbon dioxide contacted moist room air and condensed. Ammonia also condensed, greatly reducing visibility. The room became untenable for anyone not wearing full protective equipment and workers were using only industrial type filter masks or chemical respirators. They left the room and called the fire department to borrow full protective gear. When firemen arrived, they were told that the leak had been isolated, that it had not been prolonged, and that only residual gas remained. Water was sprayed in the room to absorb the ammonia, and a fan was set up. After considering various alternatives, the firefighters decided to use an electric fork lift truck to replace the valve located 17 ft above the floor. The floor was very slippery, and the truck slid into an interior wall and the concrete curb at its base. Explosion occurred immediately.
