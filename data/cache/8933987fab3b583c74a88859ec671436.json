The explosion ruptured the 2-L reaction flask and seriously injured a researcher.  This reaction has been routinely used in our and many other laboratories to prepare 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne-1,3 on a large scale (>100 g), and no dangerous or unusual behavior was previously noted.  The procedure involves purging oxygen through a solution of TMSA in acetone in the presence of a copper(I) chloride:tetramethylethylenediamine complex catalyst at room temperature as described by Andrew B. Holmes et al. (Org. Syntheses 1993, Coll. Vol. 8, 63). The authors of the procedure recommend a safety shield as a general precaution while working with flammable materials in the atmosphere of oxygen, although no hazard was ever encountered. In this incident, the explosion occurred as soon as we started adding the solution of catalyst in acetone to the reaction. We have consulted with the pioneer of this reaction (Allan S. Hay) and the submitting author of the procedure (Holmes) and considered various scenarios to explain the explosion. Ignition of acetone/TMSA vapor by the external sources was hardly possible as the flask was well sealed and the outgoing gases were passed through a dry-ice condenser (lowering the vapor pressure below the explosive concentration) and brought to the back side of the fume hood through a 1-meter hose.  The reaction temperature (5 \u00baC) was noted by the researcher a few seconds before the explosion, thus ruling out unexpected reaction exothermy. The autoignition of the vapor on a hot stirring adapter (possibly heated by rotation-induced friction) was refuted, because joint lubrication was checked before setting up the experiment, and it would have required achieving an unrealistic temperature of greater than 300 \u00baC. Also, the explosion occurred upon adding the first few drops of copper catalyst, which makes crystallization of the explosive intermediate\u2014copper bis(trimethylsilylacetylide)\u2014highly improbable.  We speculate that a discharge of static electricity between the syringe needle and the digital thermometer inside the flask is the most likely cause of this explosion. A digital thermometer connected to a stirring hot plate (IKA) was used in the reaction, and a plastic syringe with a long metal needle was introduced through the same neck. An induced static voltage on the syringe through friction from handling (often observed in Montreal winter indoors while walking or even simply sitting) could then cause a sufficient differential potential on the needle for a discharge spark to occur close to the metallic body of the digital thermometer. The oxygen-rich atmosphere lowers the ignition energy and makes even a weak spark sufficient to cause a fire.  The incident emphasizes once more the potential danger of mixing oxygen gas with flammable solvents or reagents. More important, introducing two conductors into a flask brings a risk of static electricity discharge between the conductors, which is dangerous whenever a flammable solvent is used without inert gas. As wired metal-gauge digital thermometers are used more often in synthetic practice, precautions must be taken to avoid their contact with other metallic (conducting) parts inside the reaction flasks.\" (reprint of the full-text)", "Markup": [{"Start": 122, "Length": 23, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/trimethylsilylacetylene", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-66111"}, {"Start": 346, "Length": 32, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1%2C4-bis%28trimethylsilyl%29butadiyne", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-138279"}, {"Start": 501, "Length": 6, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Oxygen", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "Element-Oxygen"}, {"Start": 538, "Length": 7, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acetone", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-180"}, {"Start": 567, "Length": 18, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/copper%28I%29%20chloride", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-62652"}, {"Start": 586, "Length": 26, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/tetramethylethylenediamine", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-8037"}, {"Start": 870, "Length": 6, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Oxygen", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "Element-Oxygen"}, {"Start": 1017, "Length": 7, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acetone", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-180"}, {"Start": 1232, "Length": 7, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acetone", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-180"}, {"Start": 1369, "Length": 7, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/dry-ice", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-280"}, {"Start": 2005, "Length": 6, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Copper", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "Element-Copper"}, {"Start": 2080, "Length": 6, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Copper", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "Element-Copper"}, {"Start": 2787, "Length": 6, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Oxygen", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "Element-Oxygen"}, {"Start": 2959, "Length": 6, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Oxygen", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "Element-Oxygen"}]}]}}, {"ReferenceNumber": 116, "Name": "GHS Category", "Value": {"StringWithMarkup": [{"String": "Explosive"}]}}, {"ReferenceNumber": 116, "Name": "Reaction Scale", "Value": {"StringWithMarkup": [{"String": "Large (>100g)"}]}}, {"ReferenceNumber": 116, "Name": "Reaction Class", "Value": {"StringWithMarkup": [{"String": "Oxidation"}]}}, {"ReferenceNumber": 116, "Name": "Additional Information", "Value": {"StringWithMarkup": [{"String": "Note to the Reviewer: I used https://www.convertunits.com/from/liters/to/grams to convert grams to liters as liters were the unit in the article.

The incident originated in space leased by Kaltech Industries Group, Inc. Kaltech employees had just finished consolidating hazardous waste from smaller containers into two larger drums. The wastes were incompatible, and an explosion occurred. Thirty-six people were injured, including six firefighters and 14 members of the public. The building was extensively damaged. Because of the serious nature of this incident and the fact that a chemical reaction was likely involved, the U.S. Chemical Safety & Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) initiated an investigation to determine the root and contributing causes of the incident and to issue recommendations to help prevent similar occurrences. ... The workers who consolidated the waste told CSB investigators that the last carboy they pumped from was unique because it was a silvercolored metal and the others were plastic. CSB investigators found only one such carboy onsite, located near the elevator. The New York City Department of Environmental Protection recovered a sample of brownish-colored liquid from the container and reported it to be concentrated nitric acid. Investigators also observed numerous plastic carboys in the area of the consolidation. Analysis by OSHA indicates that several of these carboys contained dissolved metals (consistent with acidic etching solution) commingled with lacquer thinner. Lacquer thinner is primarily composed of acetone and toluene. If it comes into contact with concentrated nitric acid, a reaction may release heat and gas. Although CSB investigators could not identify the exact chemistry that led to pressurization of the plastic drum, a reaction between nitric acid and lacquer thinner is most likely to have occurred.", "Markup": [{"Start": 1255, "Length": 11, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitric%20acid", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-944"}, {"Start": 1555, "Length": 7, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acetone", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-180"}, {"Start": 1567, "Length": 7, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/toluene", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-1140"}, {"Start": 1619, "Length": 11, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitric%20acid", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-944"}, {"Start": 1802, "Length": 11, "URL": "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitric%20acid", "Type": "PubChem Internal Link", "Extra": "CID-944"}]}]}}]}, {"TOCHeading": "Special Reports", "Description": "Special reports on the safety and hazard of this chemical.
